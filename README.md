First coding challenge I took a swing at while working to improve my python skills. As such you will notice some lovely features
such as:
1) PEP8 non-compliancy
2) Reliance on for loops rather than list comprehensions
3) lack of object oriented thought.

This was a successful project not because it works but because it helped reveal where my future growth should occur.  Later 
projects are focused on improving my strength in the three listed deficiencies above.
